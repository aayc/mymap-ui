# My Map Enhanced UI Project

_This project has been deprecated, but inspired the byu-coursemajor-api project_

## About
BYU's MyMap schedule registration system is good, but could benefit from some enhancements, including:

* Typeahead drop downs for fast class selection
* Integrated professor ratings pulled from a variety of sources
* Given user selected classes, automatically generated schedule possiblities

This project aims to create an alternate interface to the BYU scheduling system.
