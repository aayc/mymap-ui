We want to scrap the class search url:
http://saasta.byu.edu/noauth/classSchedule/index.php

probably using nightmarejs
So, you can probably hard-code load the course list.

Make nightmarejs select each department and search it

Then grab all the HTML from the table, and press the next button if it's enabled.

Make sure you aggregate all the HTML, then pass to Beautiful soup Python extractor.

In python, aggregate all the classes together, match the department name with the class name (it matches, right?)
Output as a JSON structure

{ "department" : [{"name": "MATH 314", "time" : "blah blah", "prof":"etcetc"}]}

Then when the localhost website loads, pull the list of departments and NAMES only.  Make a searchable box so you can search like "Math 314" and have it return.  DEFINITELY keep track of the course description to make everything indexable.

Make sure students can aggregate all their classes into a listbox.  Clicking on a class in the listbox brings up the "rate all the professors"

Then maybe a scheduler widget where you can deselect times and stuff, and a backtracker solver.

Have fun!
